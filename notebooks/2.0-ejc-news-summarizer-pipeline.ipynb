       " {'Title': 'International rights group seeks end to red-tagging',\n",
       "  'Content': '\\n MANILA, Philippines — Ahead of the country’s implementation of its controversial antiterror law starting Jan. 15, the international human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called for an end to the Philippine government’s “pernicious” practice of red-tagging leftist activists and critics who are at “serious risk.”\\n In its annual World Report 2024, which surveys human rights practices in more than 100 countries, HRW observed how the Marcos administration has “increasingly constricted democratic space by using the justice system to target leftist activist groups.”\\n While the group took note of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s “measured rhetoric” about human rights, it said that many of the abuses reported under his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, remained rampant.\\n HRW also pointed out that there seemed to be no “evident efforts to end the practice” despite Marcos’ promise to improve the country’s human rights situation.\\n The group specifically expressed concern over Red-tagging, which recently has turned into “terrorist-tagging,” as the government wields its “harsh and overbroad” Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 (Republic Act No. 11479) to target civil society organizations.\\n It cited the humanitarian group Community Empowerment Resource Network, which, after being Red-tagged by the military, was charged with providing funds to the New People’s Army (NPA).\\n This practice appears to have paved the way for another phenomenon: the abductions of and subsequent “surrender” of activists, HRW said. It pointed to the abduction of Cebu-based activists Dyan Gumanao and Armand Dayoha at a port in Cebu City, who later surfaced to accuse state agents of kidnapping them.\\n Last September, environmental activists Jonila Castro and Jhed Tamano also went missing and were later presented to the media by state forces who claimed they were NPA fighters.\\n But in a separate state-organized press conference, the two belied the claim against them and accused the military of abducting them.\\n Given these circumstances, HRW Deputy Asia director Bryony Lau urged the Marcos administration to “end the pernicious practice of labeling government opponents as communists.”\\n “Red-tagging is a form of harassment that can lead to deadly abuses, and runs counter to Marcos’ pledge to promote human rights,” he said.\\n One such example that underscored how this practice could lead to other violations is the case of ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro, who has not only borne the brunt of the government’s Red-tagging but is also consistently branded as an NPA sympathizer.\\n On Jan. 9, the Quezon City Prosecutor’s Office dismissed her criminal complaint of grave threats against Duterte, citing lack of sufficient evidence.\\n The decision angered local rights groups, who questioned how the prosecutor could claim that Duterte “was not serious in hurling death threats.”\\n From its records, Karapatan said that at least 422 activists were killed during his six-year term, and another 574 survived attempts on their lives simply because of “Duterte’s explicit kill orders through public statements in front of soldiers and police.”\\n “The number of Duterte’s victims is no joke. It is never a laughing matter to be threatened by a brutal fascist with a murderous history like Duterte. The Quezon City prosecutor must reconsider the decision and indict Duterte for the grave threats he said against Representative Castro,” Karapatan said.\\n ',\n",

       " {'Title': 'Gov’t responsible for subsidy on modern PUVs – CHR',\n",
       "  'Content': '\\n MANILA, Philippines — For the first time since the Marcos administration imposed a hard deadline for jeepneys to consolidate into fleets, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has declared that the government should “efficiently subsidize” the public utility vehicle modernization program (PUVMP) and make sure it would not trample on the rights of drivers, operators and commuters.\\n In a statement issued last Friday at the Inquirer’s request, the CHR said it recognizes the need for safer and more environment-friendly transportation modes but stressed that “adhering strictly to rigid consolidation deadlines may jeopardize PUV operators’ right to a sustainable livelihood.”\\n “The Commission believes that genuine progress is inclusive and leaves no one behind. Given the economic and financial implications of PUVMP, the majority of the program’s financial burden will fall on drivers and operators,” it noted.\\n The CHR called on the government to “efficiently subsidize the program, develop an effective communication strategy for the general public, and make the implementing rules and regulations of PUVMP more understandable.”\\n The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board had announced that jeepney operators and drivers only have until Jan. 31 to consolidate into cooperatives or corporations and take the first major step toward fulfilling the PUVMP. This was another extension from an earlier deadline, the most recent being Dec. 31.\\n The program requires that traditional, diesel-run PUVs like jeepneys and UV Expresses shift to Euro-4-friendly units, which are pegged at a steep P2.4 million.\\n Jeepney operators and drivers have argued that this imposition infringes on their right to livelihood and just transition, as many of them cannot shoulder the huge costs of modernization. This is also why they have been clamoring for the CHR to weigh in on the program.\\n In response, the commission affirmed their concerns and urged the government to pursue its program “without violating fundamental human rights.”\\n It cited multiple reports and studies that argue that many jeepney drivers may lose their jobs because of the program’s high entry barriers.\\n For the think tank Ibon Foundation, the costs of modernization cover not only the unit cost but also the expenses associated with forming and coordinating a cooperative or corporation and maintaining those units.\\n “[That] the government set a ceiling of P80,000 in subsidies per unit despite the updated jeepneys costing upward of P1 million does not alleviate fears that the program will simply push poorer operators out, allowing well-financed corporations to take over,” the CHR underscored.\\n The CHR also reminded the Marcos government that the program’s consequences extended to commuters who bear the brunt of strikes and protests by the affected public utility groups.\\n “In the context of the PUVMP, it is necessary to avoid actions that may impose an undue burden on the public. This includes avoiding financial difficulties for small transportation operators and protecting the livelihoods of the numerous drivers involved,” the commission said.\\n “The potential consequences, such as pushing these drivers and their families into poverty, highlight the need for a balanced and considerate approach in implementing modernization efforts to ensure they align with wider societal welfare,” it added.\\n The commission also affirmed the jeepney operators and drivers’ right to self-organization as well as their right to strike in accordance with the law, as enshrined in the 1987 Constitution.\\n It cited the International Labor Organization Convention 87 (ILOC 87), which states that “workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to the rules of the organization concerned, to join organizations of their own choosing without prior authorization.”\\n “Needless to say, participating in a cooperative should be a voluntary decision,” the CHR added.\\n Meanwhile, transport groups Manibela and Piston said they would lead a protest march on Tuesday.\\n At least 15,000 people—including jeepney drivers, operators, commuters and students—are expected to join the march from the University of the Philippines Diliman to Mendiola, Manibela chair Mar Valbuena announced in a forum on Sunday.\\n Valbuena said they would call on President Marcos to reconsider his stance on the PUVMP and retract the impending revocation of franchises of unconsolidated PUVs.\\n “We would like to appeal to the President to return the revoked franchise of our operators. Because this would result in loss of income for our drivers and operators, and also a loss of transportation means for the public,” he said.\\n Around 30,000 jeepneys in Metro Manila have yet to consolidate into cooperatives, according to Manibela. —WITH A REPORT FROM FRANCES MANGOSING INQ\\n ',\n",

       "  'Content': '\\n MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Immigration (BI) arrested in 2023 a total of 128 foreign fugitives wanted for various crimes in their homelands.\\n In a report to Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco, the BI’s fugitive search unit (FSU) said the alien fugitives were captured in various operations conducted nationwide, particularly in areas where the foreigners were hiding or have stayed since they arrived in the country.\\n Nearly all of the captured fugitives were already deported and are already serving time in prison in their respective countries after being convicted of the crimes they allegedly committed, the bureau added.\\n The FSU also reported that 39 South Koreans account for the bulk of the arrested fugitives, followed by 25 Chinese nationals, 15 Vietnamese, 12 Taiwanese, 11 Americans and eight Japanese. Offenses committed include involvement in economic crimes, investment scams, illegal gambling, money laundering, telecommunications fraud, robbery and smuggling.\\n Among the notable arrests in March involved Manpreet Singh and his cohorts. They were tagged as members of an extremist group called the Khalistan Tiger Force in India, which is reportedly known for promoting “acts of terrorism” and targeted killings.\\n Also arrested in 2023 were Risa Yamada, Fujita Kairi and Sato Shohei for their affiliation with the infamous “Luffy” syndicate, known for a string of robberies in Japan.\\n Tansingco said all of them were already included in the immigration blacklist of undesirable aliens. Hence, they are perpetually barred from reentering the country.\\n He added the operations against the fugitives send a signal that the Philippines is not a refuge or sanctuary for foreign criminals who want to evade arrest and prosecution for crimes they committed in their respective countries.\\n “Our country is off limits to these foreign fugitives. They are not welcome here, and there will be no letup in our campaign to hunt and deport them so they could be tried for the criminal cases that were filed against them,” the Immigration chief said in a statement.\\n ',\n",
